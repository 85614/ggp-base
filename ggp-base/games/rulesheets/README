Heya,

Some quick notes on the games/rulesheets/ directory. I have tried to compile
an authoritative collection of game rulesheets in this directory, pulling the
best-commented versions from the Stanford archive or the Dresden archive. Yet,
there's a lot of work still to do. A small number of games in this directory
have various flaws, and others are poorly formatted or poorly commented.

I'd like to ultimately come up with a better system for storing rulesheets and
stylesheets, such that you always have access to the latest version of a game
with the most accurate comments and some indication whether or not any subtle
bugs have been discovered in it, but that's nothing more than a design doc at
the moment.
